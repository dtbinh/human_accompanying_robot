	\section{INTRODUCTION} \label{sec:intro}
	The application of autonomous robots for search-and-rescue (SAR) missions have received considerable attentions in last decades \cite{casper2003human,nourbakhsh2005human,kruijff2012designing}.
	One particular interesting scenario is allowing robots to autonomously accompany humans during the SAR, assisting humans in carrying heavy apparatus, detecting signals of survivors or exploring dangerous areas.
	% Motion planning of human-companion robots is a challenging problem and its solution has numerous applications, such as for accompanying elderlies at home and guiding visitors in museums. 
	
	To make the robot's companion behavior natural and amiable, referred to as being \textit{socially desirable}, several requirements need to be satisfied, including the safety and comfort \cite{kruse2013human}.
	Safety serves as the fundamental guideline, requiring that robots avoid collision with accompanied humans under all circumstances \cite{hoeller2007accompanying,fox1997dynamic,svenstrup2010trajectory}.
	% 	\todohere{use lit from the survey paper. explain many aspects of social navigation. However, in problem formulation, just list what is done in this paper: focus on comfortableness (distance using proxemics and velocity similarity)}
	Comfort requires robots to pose little annoyance and stress for the accompanied humans \cite{kruse2013human}.
	It is mainly formulated regarding the distance that a robot needs to keep from people.
	The ''Proxemics" model, proposed by Hall et al. \cite{hall1968proxemics}, has been adopted for designing robot's human-friendly motion behavior \cite{barnaud2014proxemics,rios2012navigating}.
	This model denotes a virtual zone around a person that robots should avoiding entering in order to prevent the discomfort that the person may feel.
	Similarity on speed between the human and the robot has also been considered as a contributing factor for comfort \cite{henry2010learning}.
	%	For example, Hall \cite{hall1968proxemics} proposed the concept of ''Proxemics" to denote the virtual zone around a person that other people should avoiding entering in order to prevent the discomfort the person may feel.
	%	Barnaud et al.\cite{barnaud2014proxemics} investigated the proxemics models in the context of human-aware robot navigation by investigating a classic corridor-crossing experiment.
	%	This work provides a tool for designing parameters of the proxmics model that can be used for robot motion planning in the environment with human existence.
	%	Naturalness and sociability reflect the requirements on \todohere{finish this sentence}.
	%     \todohere{rephrase the following sentence:}
	%     In \cite{takayama2009influences}, authors extract robot design principles for approaching distance and gaze depending on social context.
	
	%	\todohere{move the following sentence to the method review section}
	%	By incorporating these requirements into account, researchers have developed several human-companion robots. 
	%	In \cite{kirby Companion: A constraintoptimizing method for person acceptable navigation}, a generalized framework for representing social conventions as components of a constrained optimization problem was presented and it was used for path planning and navigation.
	
	% the former requires robots to maintain appropriate distance from humans and the latter emphasizes on the similarity in motion speeds between robots and humans. 
	% This requires robots to stay within a proper distance from the accompanied person while avoiding collision with him/her.
	% In fact, aside from the traditional requirement of robot path planning that focuses on obtaining the optimal path from one position to another in real-time, the human-aware robot motion planning needs to take the existence of humans into account.
	% This imposes certain requirements on the robot motion, such as safety, comfortableness and naturalness.
	% Safety serves as the fundamental requirements for robots to interact with humans and it requires robots to avoid hurting humans. 
	% Based on the definition in \cite{kruse2013human}, comfortableness requires robots to pose little annoyance and stress for humans and naturalness emphasizes the similarity between robots and humans in low-level behavior patterns.
	% In this work, we develop an approach for robots to follow humans in real time without the prior knowledge of the human trajectory. 
	% The planned robot motion takes the safety, comfortableness and naturalness requirements into consideration.
	
	%	Cosgun et al.\cite{cosgun2013autonomous} develops a robot for telepresence usage, which uses the laser scanner to track human movement and predicts human path by extrapolating based on the estimated human position and speed, assuming a constant velocity human motion model.
	%	The robot utilizes the depth-limited breadth-first search approach to find the waypoints around the predicted human positions so that the robot can always face the accompanied human with a similar velocity as the human.
	%	Hoeller et al.\cite{hoeller2007accompanying} presents a local path planning approach for the companion robot to stay in proximity to the target person and simultaneously prevent colliding with any passers-by. 
	%	The probabilistic roadmaps is used to plan collision-free paths to a given target location, chosen based on the predicted adjacent humans' positions.
	%	A laser-based people tracking technique is used to estimate the motions of humans and a potential field method is applied for predicting the humans’ future trajectories.
	
	%	Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is adopted for human motion prediction. 
	In order to generate socially desirable motion behavior, accurate human motion prediction is necessary.
	% We divide the human-accompanying motion planning into three steps.
	To be specific, a robot needs to predict human future trajectory based on the human's motion states that are estimated from measurement of equipment such as GPS sensors or cameras.
	%	Previous work on human state estimation and prediction is generally composed of two frameworks: model-based and model-free approaches.
	Filtering methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF) and the particle filter (PF), have been applied for tracking moving objects \cite {koller1994robust,rui2001better}, assuming certain motion pattern, such as the constant speed and direction model \cite{svenstrup2010trajectory,bruce2004better}.
	These single-model filtering approaches can effectively predict human motion when the people follow the assumed motion pattern.
	However, when the human movement involves multiple models, such as making turns with changing speed, such methods may fail to give accurate prediction.
	
	% Due to the sensor noise, measurement results need filtering.
	%	There exist several widely-adopted estimation methods. Huang et al.\cite {Future_Trajectory} presents vehicle future trajectory based on GPS sensor using Kalman filter (KF),which provides the minimum mean square error estimation of states for linear systems with Gaussian noise. 
	%such as the Kalman filter(KF)\cite{welch1995introduction}, which provides the minimum mean square error estimation of states for linear systems with Gaussian noise. %\todohere{find references for its application to motion estimation and prediction}  
	%	The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) \cite {KalmanFiltering}, which are extensions of the KF for nonlinear systems, have also been applied for motion estimation and prediction\cite{key}. 
	%	EKF can be obtained by applying the KF to the first-order Taylor expansion of nonlinear systems while UKF uses a deterministic sampling technique, called the Unscented Transform, to perform a stochastic linearization through the use of a weighted statistical linear regression process \cite{thrun2005probabilistic}. 
	%	Schubert et al. \cite{Motion_model} compares the motion models for the vehicle tracking with UKF.  
	%	The motion model, such as the constant velocity and constant turn model, can be applied for predicting the future path of the vehicle based on the estimated states. 
	%	\todonote{try to merge the following sentence with the previous one. }
	%	These methods usually assumes a single motion model for estimation and prediction and have been widely applied in motion planning and localization in the field of robotics \cite{thrun2005probabilistic}.
	
	Learning techniques have also been utilized for human motion prediction in recent years. 
	% 	In \cite{wu2012path}, Wu et al. developed a path prediction approach by back propagating through a trained Netural Network. 
	%     The proposed method is shown to be able to predict abrupt human direction change when a person makes turns. 
	Bennewitz et al. \cite{bennewitz2005learning} proposed a prediction approach based on the hidden Markov model, utilizing the clustered collections of trajectories that characterize typical motion patterns of persons.
	Fulgenzi et al. \cite{fulgenzi2008probabilistic} developed a Gaussian process-based motion predictor, using pre-learned human motion patterns.
	Other leaning techniques, such as the neural networks, have also been utilized for motion prediction \cite{foka2010probabilistic,wu2012path}.
	% 	A two-layer prediction that combined long-term destination inference and short-term motion prediction was proposed in \cite{foka2010probabilistic}:
	% 	the short-term prediction was achieved by a pre-trained Polynomial Neural Network (PNN);
	% 	the long-term prediction was performed by utilizing the heading direction of a human to determine his/her destinations.
	%     These locations were pre-defined by utilizing the human motion data.
	%     Ziebart et al. \cite{ziebart2009planning} proposed the maximum entropy inverse optimal control approach for modeling goal-directed trajectories of pedestrians.
	%     Such modeling method offers the benefit of the generality of its learned cost function to changes in the environment and to entirely different environments.
	% 	\todohere{more references on human motion estimation and prediction.}
	These learning-based approaches have achieved success in predicting human motion in the environments where human trajectories have been previously collected for training.
	%	However, they usually involves the collection of training data (e.g., recorded human trajectory) and are prone to be scenario specific. 
	%	In fact, human motion can be well predicted using these learning-based approaches in the environments where human trajectories have been collected for training predictors.
	However, they may fail to obtain accurate prediction in unknown environments that no training data is available.
	This drawback renders the learning-based prediction methods less applicable for SAR missions since disaster sites are diverse and rarely similar to the known ones.
	% 	Therefore robots need to work in unfamiliar environments.
	
	In this work, we propose an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)-based human motion estimation and prediction approach, taking advantage of the fact that human motion usually involves different motion models \cite{aggarwal1999human}, such as straight-line movement, making turns and change of speed.
	Such IMM-based approach incorporates several motion models and dynamically adjusts the mode probabilities based on the observed human trajectory.
	To deal with the nonlinearity of the human motion, such as making turns, Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF) is applied to each model in the IMM framework, resulting in the so-called IMM-UKF approach.
	Such approach can achieve higher prediction accuracy and faster response compared to single-model filtering methods such as KF and PF. 
	Additionally, IMM-UKF does not need training and is thus applicable to unknown environments, which is advantageous over learning-based methods for SAR missions.
	
	Utilizing the predicted human trajectory, a model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner is developed that formulates the motion planning as a nonlinear programming, which conveniently considers the safety and comfort requirements.
	%	robot motion planner that generates socially desirable companion behavior is necessary. 
	%	Several motion planner have been proposed in previous work.
	%	For example, Hoeller et al.\cite{hoeller2007accompanying} presents a local path planning approach based on the expansive-spaces tree algorithm, which repeatedly computes collision-free paths from the robot’s current position to a target position near the person using a randomized search in configuration space.
	%	Fulgenzi et al.\cite{fulgenzi2008probabilistic} proposed an extended Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm that takes the likelihood of the obstacles trajectory and the probability of collision into account for robot path planning in a dynamic uncertain environment.
	%	Similar RRT approaches have also been adopted in \cite{barnaud2014proxemics,rios2011understanding}.	
	%	The probabilistic roadmaps is used to plan collision-free paths to a given target location, chosen based on the predicted adjacent humans' positions.	
	%	
	%	The main contribution of this paper is that we proposed a model-based human motion predictor that takes several human motion patterns into account.
	%	Such approach can achieve higher prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods that utilizes a single motion model.
	%	In addition, the prediction performance does not rely on any training data and thus not scenario-dependent, which is advantageous over learning-based methods for search and rescue missions.

	The MPC planner with IMM-UKF prediction is evaluated using a simulated SAR scenario, in which the human rescuer moves sequentially to several destinations and the robot needs to accompany. 
	%	Simulation results show that the IMM-based predictor provides superior prediction performance than other filtering-based methods.
	Simulation results show that the IMM-UKF provides superior prediction performance than other methods.
	Using the MPC motion planner, the robot has successfully accompanied the human in a safe and comfortable manner.

	% 	Second, the model-based IMM-UKF approach does not require training data and is scenario-independent, which is advantageous over the machine learning methods, such as the ANN method in \cite{bennewitz2005learning,fulgenzi2008probabilistic,foka2010probabilistic}.

	% 	Motion requirements such as the safety and comfort can be easily incorporated in the objective function and constraints of the nonlinear program.
	% 	\todonote{need to find more ref about motion planning methods for navigating in human environments}
	% 	Besides, such MPC-based planner can be implemented in real-time, which makes it suitable for dynamic environments. 
	%     This differs from some sampling-based planning methods, such as that requires large computation time potential field based methods, such as in \cite{hoeller2007accompanying}, which needs careful design of potential functions to enforce all these requirements.

	\section{PROBLEM FORMULATION}\label{sec:formulation}
	Consider the SAR scenario (\cref{fig:ref_traj_init}) in which a human first responder needs to deliver medical treatment to several destinations that contain injured people. 
	A companion robot that carries medical apparatus will accompany the human and sequentially move to these destinations.
	% The red circle and the green triangle at the lower-left corner denote the human and the robot, respectively. 
	The robot has no knowledge about the positions of human destinations.
	However, it can measure human positions in real time from the GPS sensor that the human carries.
	
	Several obstacles exist in the field, including five stationary ones (blue rectangles), representing unmovable obstructions such as buildings or plants, and two moving ones (pink dots with arrows showing moving direction) representing mobile objects such as pedestrians or vehicles.
	The positions of stationary obstacles are known to both the human and the companion robot while the moving obstacles are measured using same measurement tool for tracking the human rescuer.
	%	Neither the human nor the robot can step into or cross these obstacles. 
	When accompanying the human, the robot should satisfy the aforementioned safety and comfort requirements, illustrated in \cref{fig:zone}.
	%     , which requires the robot to avoid colliding with either the human or any obstacles and maintain a proper distance from the accompanied human.
	To be specific, a circular ``unsafety zone'' with radius $d_s$ is defined around the target person.
	Stepping into the ``unsafety zone'' is considered as unsafe behavior and thus should be strictly prohibited.
	The comfort requires the robot to stay within a ``comfort range'' of  distance from the human and also keep similar speed.
	% 	Unlike the safety requirement, the violation of comfort is acceptable, though not desirable.
	Comfort is a soft constraint in that it is acceptable, but not desirable, that the robot moves outside of the ``comfort range''.
	
	%We apply our method to the robot so that it can track the human motion and plan its own behavior.
	%The performance of the robot will be evaluated based on these three requirements.

	\section{METHODS} \label{sec:framework}
	%Effective human-accompanying requires the robot to perform three steps: human tracking, human motion prediction and robot motion planning.
	%First, the robot needs to estimate human states over time from noisy sensor data.
	%Second, the robot needs to predict human motion in the future based on the estimation results.
	%Based on the prediction, the robot plans its own motion in a socially acceptable way.
	%The following subsections details the methods for each of the three steps.
	
	\subsection{Human Motion Estimation and Prediction}\label{subsec:human_track}
	\subsubsection{Interacting Multiple Model}\label{subsec:imm}
	
	The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) approach are usually applied for estimating the system states from the noisy sensor data.
	% 	The IMM approach has been generally considered as the mainstream method for maneuvering target estimation. 
	It utilizes a bank of $r$ number of filters, each corresponding to a different motion model.
	% IMM algorithm is a sub-optimal algorithm based on the minimum mean square error criterion. 
	%	State estimate at time $k$ is computed with mode probabilities and state estimates from each possible current model associated with one of the $r$ filters, using the following formula:
	State estimate at time $k$ is computed as a weighted sum of estimates from each filter, as shown in the following formula:
	\begin{equation}
	\hat{x}(k|k)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{r}\mu_j(k)\hat{x}^j(k|k) \label{eqn:imm_eq}
	\end{equation}
	where $\hat{x}^j(k|k)$ represents the state estimate from the $j^\text{th}$ filter; $\mu_j(k)$ stands for the mode probability and is computed as follows:
	\[
	\mu_j(k)=\frac{1}{c}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{r}L_{ij}(k)p_{ij}\mu_j(k-1)
	\]
	where $c$ denotes the normalizing factor; $L_{ij}(k)$ stands for the Gaussian likelihood of receiving the current measurement given all previous measurements and that the $j^\text{th}$ model is in effect at time k; $p_{ij}$ represents the mode transition probability from the $i^\text{th}$ to the $j^\text{th}$ model. 
	Each filter uses the mixed initial state estimate and covariance from an interaction of the $r$ filters, which consists of the combination of the estimates with the mixing probability at previous time step.
	Readers interested in the details of the IMM approach can refer to \cite{yaakov2001estimation}.
	% 	The IMM approach offers the benefits of incorporating multiple motion models in the estimation process, which makes it suitable for human state estimation since when a person moves, it usually involves multiple motion patterns.
	% We now motivate the use if nonlinear models in the IMM by introducing a popular nonlinear model used in target tracking. It is the Coordinated Turn model, whose name is derived from the aerospace industry. A coordinated turn is a turn in which the turn rate and speed are constant. If the turn rate is a known constant the model is linear. \cite {derek_phd_dissertation} 
	
	% Unfortunately, the turn rate of the human is rarely constant. Thus the coordinated turn model will be augmented with the turn rate as additional state. Therefore it is necessary to use an nonlinear system.
	In this work, two different dynamic models are used in the IMM framework: one is the coordinated turn motion model, reflecting the action of making turns or moving along a curved path, and the other is the uniform motion model, representing the straight-line movement. 
	The equation for the coordinated turn motion is shown below:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align*}
		x^{h,1}(k+1)&= f(x^{h,1}(k))+Gw_1(k) \\ 
		%Q(k)&=E[w(k)w(k)^\top]
		f(x^{h,1}(k))&=\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
		p^h_1+\frac{\sin(\omega^h T)}{\omega^h}v^h_1-\frac{1-\cos(\omega^h T)}{\omega^h}v^h_2\\
		\cos(\omega^h T)v^h_1-\sin(\omega^h T)v^h_2\\
		p^h_2+\frac{1-\cos(\omega^h T)}{\omega^h}v^h_1+\frac{\sin(\omega^h T)}{\omega^h}v^h_2\\
		\sin(\omega^h T)v^h_1+\cos(\omega^h T)v^h_2\\
		\omega^h 
		\end{array}\right] \\
		G &= \left[
		\begin{array}{ccc}
		\frac{T^2}{2}& 0& 0\\
		T& 0& 0\\
		0& \frac{T^2}{2}& 0\\
		0& T& 0\\
		0& 0& 1\\
		\end{array}\right] \\
		w_1&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,Q).
		\end{align*}
	\end{subequations}
	
	Also, the equation of the uniform motion is represented as follows:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align*}
		x^{h,2}(k+1)&= Ax^{h,2}(k)+Bw_2(k) \label{eqn:h_d_dyn}\\
		A=\left[
		\begin{array}{ccccc}
		1& T& 0& 0& 0\\
		0& 1& 0& 0& 0\\
		0& 0& 1& T& 0\\
		0& 0& 0& 1& 0\\
		0& 0& 0& 0& 0\\
		\end{array}\right]&,\;
		B=\left[
		\begin{array}{ccc}
		\frac{T^2}{2}& 0& 0\\
		T& 0& 0\\
		0& \frac{T^2}{2}& 0\\
		0& T& 0\\
		0& 0& 1\\
		\end{array}\right] \\
		w_2&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,Q)
		\end{align*}
	\end{subequations}
	where $x^{h,i}(k)$, $i=1,2$ represents the human motion state including five elements : $p^h_1,v^h_1,p^h_2,v^h_2,\omega^h$, where $p^h_1,p^h_2$ denote the longitudinal and lateral position of the human, $v^h_1,v^h_2$ the corresponding velocity and $\omega^h$ the turn rate of the human; $w_i(k)$, $i=1,2$ represents process noise; $T$ represents the sampling time; Q is the covariance matrix of the process noise.
	
	The uniform motion model is essentially a special case of the coordinated turn motion model with the turn rate $\omega$ being fixed to zero.
	%	while the coordinated turn motion model considers the turn rate as a time-varying value.
	%	If the human motion can be covered by a single model, the need for the IMM is eliminated.
	%	Though the uniform motion model is a special case of the coordinated turn motion model and thus it seems to be sufficient to only consider the coordinated turn motion model, 
	%It seems that only considering the coordinated turn motion model suffices to estimate human motion states, in addition to the benefits of reduced computations by using the single model.
	%However, including two models are necessary since this allows the estimator for fast detection of change of motions. 
	%	This trade-off between computation and motion-change detection is main argument when choosing a single or a multiple model approach. 
	%The decision to select the estimator is a bit clearer in linear case since the turn rate is fixed in linear dynamic models. In other words, the diverse turn rate allows that the estimation of the human motion is more accurate.
	It seems that only considering the coordinated turn motion model suffices to estimate human motion states, in addition to the benefits of reduced computations by using the single model.
	However, including two models are necessary since this allows the estimator for fast detection of change of motions, which is shown in \cite{}.
	%	In other words, it is common to include one uniform motion model and one coordinated turn motion model for quick motion-change detection. 
	%	Since human motion usually involves different motions in the real world, 
	The ability to quickly detect the change of the motion is one of the important properties for the estimation and prediction.          	
	
	% In continuous time domain, the equations of the coordinated turn motion model can be written as 
	% \begin{subequations}
	% \begin{align}
	% \dot{x^h}(t)&= \left[
	% \begin{array}{c}

	% \end{array}\right]w(t)\label{eqn:h_c_dyn}
	% \end{align}
	% \end{subequations}
	
	
	% % $x^h(k)$ consists of four elements: $x^h_1,\dot{x}^h_1,x^h_2,\dot{x}^h_2$, where 
	% % We use two Linear Kalman Filters in the IMM for human tracking, each corresponding to a different dynamics model: the uniform motion model and the turn motion model.
	% When this continuous system is discretized, the equation becomes
	
	
	% With a single nonlinear model, accurate state estimates are possible over all target motions and maneuvers may be inferred from the state estimates themselves. However, in nonlinear multiple model approach, it is common to include one uniform motion model and one coordinated turn model for quick maneuver detection\cite {derek_phd_dissertation}. 	
	\addtocounter{equation}{-2}
	
	The observation equation is represented as : 
	\begin{equation}
	y^h(k)=Cx^h(k)+v(k)\label{eqn:n_observation}
	\end{equation}
	where $y^h(k)$ denotes the observed human state at the time step $k$; $v(k)$ stands for measurement noise. 
	
	By using GPS sensors, the human positions can be measured.
	Therefore, the parameters in observation model \cref{eqn:n_observation} is defined as:
	\addtocounter{equation}{-1}
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align*}
		C&=\left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}

		\end{array}\right],\\
		v&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,V)
		\end{align*}
	\end{subequations}
	where $V$ is the convariance matrix of the measurement noise.
	The above two models are utilized for human motion state estimation, in combination with the Unscented Kalman Filter.
	
	% Two models differ in the $A$ matrix and $w$ in \cref{eqn:hn_dyn} while sharing the same $B_w$.
	% In particular, we define the matrices as follows:

	\subsubsection{Unscented Kalman Filter}\label{subsec:UKF}
	% We select the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) among the nonlinear estimation methods since the UKF is a versatile engineering tool that once understood can provide good nonlinear estimation results for many practical problems. Due to lack of Jacobian matrix calculation, the UKF can also be constructed and altered more easily than the Exteded Kalman Filter (EKF) in the prototyping stages of filter design. 
	% In other words, the UKF circumvents the first-order linearization by implementing the Unscented Transformation (UT), which calculates the statistics of a random vector that undergoes a nonlinear transformation\cite {KalmanFiltering}.
	% The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) circumvents the first-order linearization by implementing the Unscented Transformation (UT), which calculates the statistics of a random vector that undergoes a nonlinear transformation\cite {KalmanFiltering}
	The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied to each model that are used in IMM framework for estimating human states. 
	It is an effective state estimation technique for nonlinear systems by implementing the Unscented Transformation (UT) that calculates the statistics of a random vector that undergoes a nonlinear transformation\cite {haykin2004kalman}.
	% The UT is the central technique of the UKF which is used to handle the non-linearity in a nonlinear transformation. 
	% This method provides the mean and covariance of the Gaussian Random Vector (GRV) at least second-order accuracy(Taylor Series Expansion) through use a set of sample points. 
	To be specific, given an arbitrary nonlinear dynamic model $z=g(x)$ and a $L$-dimensional Gaussian Random Vector (GRV) $x$ with mean $\hat{x}$ and covariance $P_x$, the statistics of $z$ can be approximated by using $2L+1$ discrete sample points $\left\{\chi^{(i)} \right\}_{i=0}^{2L}=\left\{ \hat{x}\ \text{and}\  \hat{x} \pm \sigma_j, j=1,...,L\right \}$, called \textit{sigma points}, where $\sigma_j$ is the $j^{th}$ column of the matrix $\sqrt{(L+\lambda)P_x}$. $\lambda$ is a scaling parameter, as defined below:
	
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
		\lambda&=\alpha^2(L+\kappa)-L  \label{eqn:ukf}\\
		W_0^{(m)}&=\frac{\lambda}{L+\lambda}\\
		W_0^{(c)}&=\frac{\lambda}{L+\lambda}+1-\alpha^2+\beta\\
		W_i^{(m)}&=W_i^{(c)}=\frac{1}{L+\lambda},\quad i=1,...,2L 
		%\gamma&=\sqrt{L+\lambda}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $\alpha$ determines the spread of sigma points about the mean $\hat{x}$; $\kappa$ is a secondary scaling parameter; $\beta$ is used to incorporate prior knowledge of the distribution.	
	
	Once the sigma points have been generated, each point is passed through the nonlinear function $z=g(x)$, i.e. each column of the sigma points is propagated through the non-linearity, as in $\zeta^{(i)}=g(\chi^{(i)}), i=0,...,2L$. The mean $\hat{z}$ and the covariance $P_z$ are approximated as $\hat{z}\simeq \Sigma_{i=0}^{2L}W_i^{(m)} \zeta^{(i)}$ and $P_z \simeq  \Sigma_{i=0}^{2L}W_i^{(c)}(\zeta^{(i)}-\hat{z})(\zeta^{(i)}-\hat{z})^\mathsf{T}$, calculated as given in above equations of the weights and parameters\cite{hong2013vehicle}. The state estimate, $\hat{x}^j(k|k)$, $j=1,...,r$ in \cref{eqn:imm_eq}, can be computed like $\hat{z}$ at each filter that corresponds to a different dynamic model. 
	Readers can refer to \cite {haykin2004kalman} for more details of the UKF algorithm.
	
	\subsubsection{Human Motion Prediction}\label{subsec:motion_pred}
	The estimated human motion states and the mode probabilities are utilized for predicting human future states.
	To be specific, using the uniform motion model and the turn motion model, human positions for each model can be extrapolated and then combined based on the mode probabilities to obtain the predicted positions.
	%Let $\mu_i$ denote the mode probability of the $i^{\text{th}}$ model.
	Let $\hat{x}^{h,j}(k|k)$ and $\tilde{x}^{h,j}(k+i|k)$ represent the estimated and predicted human states associated with the $j^{th}$ model at time $k$ and $k+i\,(i\ge 0)$, respectively, based on the observations up to time $k$.
	The prediction procedure works as follows:
	%	\todoQ{what's the difference between two sides of Eqn. (6c)?}
	\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:motion_pred_imm}
		\begin{align}
		\tilde{x}^h(k+l+1|k)&=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{r}\mu_j \tilde{x}^{h,j}(k+l+1|k)\\ l&=0,\dots,N-1\nonumber \\
		\tilde{x}^{h,j}(k+l+1|k)&=\Sigma_{i=0}^{2L}W_i^{(m)} \chi_{k+l+1|k}^{(i)}\\ j&=1,\dots,r\nonumber \\
		\chi_{k+l+1|k}^{(i)}&=f(\chi_{k+l|k}^{(i)}) \quad i=0,\dots, 2L\\
		%\tilde{x}^{h,j}(k|k)&=\hat{x}^{h,j}(k|k),\quad j=1,\dots r
		\chi_{k|k}^{(i)}&=\left[\hat{x}^{h,j}(k|k)\ \hat{x}^{h,j}(k|k) \pm \sigma_{m}^{h,j}(k|k) \right]\\
		\sigma^{h,j}_m(k|k)&=\sqrt{(L+\lambda)P_x^{h,j}(k|k)} \quad m=1,\dots,L 
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $N$ denotes the prediction horizon; $L$ is the dimension of $x^{h,j}$; $P_x^{h,j}(k|k)$ stands for the covariance associated with the $j^{th}$ model at time $k$; $\lambda$ is represented in \cref{eqn:ukf}.

	%\subsubsection{Prediction By Extrapolation}\label{subsubsec:pred_extpol}
	%A natural method for predicting human future states is extrapolating using the estimated position  $\hat{x},\hat{y}$ and velocity $\hat{v}_x,\hat{v}_y$. 
	%We assume the constant human heading for the extrapolation. 
	%Here we use the basic bicycle model for the human dynamics:
	%%x ̃  ̇=v ̂_x
	%%y ̃  ̇=v ̂_y
	%The discretized dynamics model becomes:
	%%x ̃(k+1)=x ̃(k)+v ̂_x Δt
	%%y ̃(k+1)=y ̃(k)+v ̂_y (k)Δt
	%%k=0,…,N
	%%where x ̃(0)=x ̂,y ̃(0)=y ̂, Δt denotes the sampling time and N represents the prediction horizon.
	
	\subsection{Robot motion Planning}\label{subsec:robot_path_plan}
	The model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilized for robot motion planning.
	%	MPC provides an effective framework for incorporating the safety and comfort requirements into the planning procedure.
	It iteratively solves a finite-horizon constrained optimal control problem:
	after computing the optimal control inputs over the planning horizon, it implements the first input and then computes for a new set of control inputs, starting from the updated state.
	%\todonote{consider removing the following part as it is included in MPC formulation}
	%The robot is modeled by a  discrete-time kinematic model with limited acceleration and angular velocity, which is formulated as follows:
	%\begin{subequations}\label{robot_dyn_ct}
	%\begin{align}
	%\dot{z}(t)&=v(t)
	%\left[\begin{array}{r}
	%\cos \theta(t)\\
	%\sin \theta(t)
	%\end{array}\right]\\
	%\dot{v}(t)&=a(t)\\
	%\dot{\theta}(t)&=w(t)
	%\end{align}
	%\end{subequations}
	%\begin{subequations}
	%\begin{align}
	%z^r(k+1)&=z^r(k)+v^r(k)
	%\left[ 
	% \begin{array}{c}
	% \cos \theta(k)\\
	% \sin \theta(k)\\
	% \end{array}
	% \right]T\label{eqn:constr:dyn_motion}\\
	% v^r(k+1)&=v^r(k)+a(k)T\label{eqn:constr:dyn_v}\\
	% \theta^r(k+1)&=\theta^r(k)+w(k)T\label{eqn:constr:dyn_theta}\\
	% a_{lb}\le \bar{a}(k+i|k)\le a_{ub},\;
	% w_{lb}\le \bar{w}(k+i|k)\le w_{ub}
	% \end{align}
	% \end{subequations}
	%We discretize the above model using Euler discretization method with the sampling time $\Delta t$.
	%Considering the time step $k$, we formulate the MPC problem that incorporates the dynamics of the robot and the requirements for robot motion:
	Let $p^h(k)=
	\left[ 
	\begin{array}{c}
	p^h_1(k)\\
	p^h_2(k)
	\end{array}\right] $ and $v^h(k)=
	\left\|\left[ 
	\begin{array}{c}
	v^h_1(k)\\
	v^h_2(k)
	\end{array}\right]\right\|_2
	$ represent the position vector and the speed of the human at time $k$, respectively.
	Notations for the estimated and predicted position vector and speed can be defined as $\hat{p}^h(k|k),\tilde{p}^h(k+i|k),\hat{v}^h(k|k),\tilde{v}^h(k+i|k)$, respectively.
	The optimal control inputs are obtained by solving the following nonlinear programming problem that incorporates the dynamics of the robot and the safety and comfort requirements:
	\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:path_plan_mpc}
		\begin{align}
		\min_{\mathbf{A}_k,\mathbf{\Theta}_k} \quad &\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} q_1\left| \left\|\bar{p}^r(k+i|k)-\tilde{p}^h(k+i|k)\right\|^2_2-d^2_{c}\right| + \notag\\

		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $\bar{p}^r(k+i|k)$, $\bar{v}^r(k+i|k)$ and $\bar{\theta}(k+i|k),\, 1\le i\le N$ represent the planned position, speed and heading angle of the robot at time $k+i$, respectively;
	$n_m$ stands for the number of moving obstacles and $\tilde{p}^{obs_m}_{l_m}$ denotes the predicted position of the $l_m$-th moving obstacle;
	$n_s$ is the number of static obstacles.
	The static obstacles are approximated by ellipses, the details of which are described in the Appendix-B.
	$h_{l_s}(\cdot)$ denotes the analytical function of the ellipse approximation of the $l_s$-th static obstacle.
	$(\mathbf{A}_k,\mathbf{\Theta}_k)$ stand for the set of optimal acceleration $\bar{a}^r$ and angular velocity $\bar{\omega}^r$ of the robot in the prediction horizon $[k,k+N-1]$, obtained by solving the above optimization problem at time $k$.
	$\bar{a}^r(k)$ and $\bar{\omega}^r(k)$ are implemented as the robot's control input at time $k$.
	
	The objective function \cref{eqn:obj} consists of two terms: the first one stands for the difference between the squared human-robot distances and the squared comfort distance $d_c$ that takes the intermediate value of the ``comfort range"; the second one represents the speed difference between the robot and the human.
	This reflects the comfort requirement that the robot stay within the ``comfort range" from the human and keep similar pace at the same time.
	$q_1$ and $q_2$ denote the weights for these two terms.
	% \cref{eqn:constr:comfort} imposes the comfortableness requirement that the robot keep a distance $d_c$ from the predicted human position within the prediction horizon $N$.
	
	The robot dynamics are defined in \cref{eqn:constr:dyn_pre_motion,eqn:constr:dyn_pre_v,eqn:constr:dyn_pre_theta} with \cref{eqn:constr:a,eqn:constr:w} being the bounds on control inputs.
	The safety constraints are imposed in \cref{eqn:constr:safety_human,eqn:constr:safety_mv_obs,eqn:constr:safety_s_obs1,eqn:constr:safety_s_obs2}.
	\cref{eqn:constr:safety_human,eqn:constr:safety_mv_obs} regulates that the robot stay at least the safety distance $d_s$ from the human and moving obstacles in order to avoid collision.
	To predict the position of moving obstacles, the same motion prediction method described in \cref{subsec:motion_pred} is applied.
	\cref{eqn:constr:safety_s_obs1,eqn:constr:safety_s_obs2} enforce the collision avoidance with static obstacles.
	To be specific, \cref{eqn:constr:safety_s_obs1} demands that each way point of the robot be kept outside of static obstacles and	\cref{eqn:constr:safety_s_obs2} requires that the trajectory connecting the adjacent waypoints not intersect with obstacles, which eliminates the path that leads the robot across obstacles.
	% 	, resulting in predicted positions $tilde{p}^{obs_m}_m(k+i|k)$, which stands for the prediction of the $m^\text{th}$ moving obstacle at time $k+i$.
	% 	\cref{key} requires the robot to stay away from the moving obstacles by distance $d_s$.
	\cref{eqn:constr:init_z,eqn:constr:init_v,eqn:constr:init_theta} initializes the robot's planned states based on its actual state at time $k$.
	
	%At every time step, the robot solves this MPC problem with a finite horizon $N$ and obtains the optimal inputs.
	%For example, at time $k$, the optimal inputs consist of $N$ pairs of acceleration and angular velocity $(a(k),w(k)),(a(k+1),w(k+1)),\dots,(a(k+N-1),w(k+N-1))$.
	%$(a(k),w(k))$ is applied and a new MPC problem is formed at time $k+1$ using the updated state $(z^r(k+1),v^r(k+1),\theta^r(k+1))$ as the initial conditions.
	
	\section{SIMULATION RESULTS \& DISCUSSION}\label{sec:results}
	\subsection{Simulation setup}
	Simulations have been run to evaluate the proposed MPC planner with IMM-UKF for prediction.
	A human rescuer will move sequentially to six targets with constant speed of $1.5m/s$ in a $84 m\times 82 m$ field, following the trajectory as shown in \cref{fig:ref_traj_h}.
	Notice that such trajectory covers several typical human motion patterns, including straight-line movement, motion following curved paths and making sharp turns.
	Therefore, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating the proposed MPC planner with IMM-UKF for prediction.
	Both the trajectory and human speed are unrevealed to the robot.
	The safety distance $d_s$ is chosen as $1m$.
	According to the research by Hall et al.\cite{hall1968proxemics}, the comfort distance range is from $1.2m$ to $3.6m$.
	In the simulation, $d_c$ is chosen as $2.4m$.
	Any distance within $[1.2m,3.6m]$ is considered a comfortable one, but the closer distance to $2.4m$ is more preferable.
	The sampling rate of GPS sensor is $20Hz$ and the variance of sensor measurement noise is considered as $2m$. 
	The robot's maximum acceleration and deceleration are set to be $1 m/s^2$ and $-3 m/s^2$ respectively and the angular velocity range is chosen to be $[-90\degree/s,90\degree/s]$.
	In the IMM estimator, the process noise and the measurement noise are set to be $1.5\times 10^{-2}$ and $1.5$, respectively. The parameters of UKF in the estimator are $L=5,\alpha=0.001, \kappa=0$ and $\beta=2$.
	The prediction horizon for the human motion is chosen as $2.5s$ and the robot iteratively computes the control inputs every $500ms$.
	% The weight in the objective function, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are set to be 1 and 0.2, reflecting that we associate higher priority with the minimization of the distance than the velocity difference.
	
	\subsection{Simulation results}
	\cref{fig:ref_traj_h,fig:ref_traj_obs1,fig:ref_traj_obs2,fig:ref_traj_accom} show both the human and robot's trajectories.	
	The performance of human motion estimation and prediction is evaluated by comparing with three other filtering methods. 
	The MPC-based robot motion planning method is then evaluated under different prediction strategies.
	\subsubsection{Human motion estimation}\label{subsubsec:motion_est}
	The error between the estimated and the actual human position and speed at each time step are compared to evaluate the estimation accuracy.
	The position error vector can be formulated as:
	\[
	\Delta^{est}_p(k)=p^h(k)-\hat{p}^h(k|k)\label{eqn:track_err_pos}\\
	\]
	where $p^h(k)$ denotes the actual human position at time $k$. 
	
	
	%Note that the $\Delta^{t}_z(k)$ and $\Delta^{t}_v(k)$ are vectors.
	
	
	% We compare IMM estimation method with a single-model estimator that adopts the same uniform motion model in IMM but without the turn motion model.
	
	%\cref{fig:track_perform} shows the tracking results using these two methods.
	%They achieve similar estimation results.
	%However, we can notice that, at the bottom right part of the plot, where the human makes a circular turn, the IMM methods estimates more accurately than the single-model approach.
	%This occurs because the IMM estimator contains the turn motion model, which can better capture the turn motion than the uniform motion model.
	%To obtain detailed comparison of these two methods, we compare the IMM-based and the single-model estimators using \cref{eqn:track_err_pos,eqn:track_err_v}.

	\cref{fig:track_pos} shows the position estimation error on longitudinal and lateral directions using four different estimators: Linear Kalman Filter (LKF), IMM-LKF, UKF and IMM-UKF. 
	In the simulation, the same turn motion model in IMM-UKF is adopted for the system dynamics in UKF; the uniform motion model in IMM-LKF is also applied as the dynamic model in LKF.  
	Several observations can be obtained in this figure. 
	First, the responses of the nonlinear estimators such as UKF and IMM-UKF are faster than the linear estimators. 
	Second, the IMM-based approaches show better performance in accuracy than the single-model approaches.
	Besides, IMM-UKF achieves the fastest response and best accuracy compared to other methods, especially when the human turns around the circular obstacle at time $50$.
	% Two methods achieves similar performance while the IMM estimator shows smaller estimation error at time $55$ and $103$, when the human turns around the circular obstacle and makes sharp turn after arriving at a destination, respectively.
	\cref{fig:track_v} compares the velocity estimation using four estimators.
	Overall, the nonlinear estimators (UKF and IMM-UKF) show faster response compared to the linear estimators (LKF and IMM-LKF), though they have overshoots due to the fast response. 
	It is worth noting that the overshoots of IMM-UKF are smaller than UKF while keeping the fast response at time $53$ and $118$ when the velocity changes abruptly.    
	% We can notice that, IMM estimator achieves faster tracking than the single-model approach when the velocity changes abruptly.
	This makes sense as the IMM-UKF estimator incorporates uniform motion model that can capture the sudden velocity changes.
	\cref{fig:mode_prob} shows the mode probabilities of the uniform motion model and turn motion model in IMM-UKF over time.
	When the human motion changes, the mode probability of the turn motion becomes higher than that of the uniform motion. 
	These changes illustrates the reason that IMM-based estimators achieve more accurate and faster estimation than the single-model estimator at the sharp turn and circular turn, thus demonstrating the necessity of applying IMM-UKF estimator for human tracking.
	
	\subsubsection{Human motion prediction}\label{subsubsec:motion_pred}
	To evaluate the IMM-UKF prediction, the average prediction error over the prediction horizon is computed and compared with the LKF, IMM-LKF and UKF. 
	At time $k$, the prediction error is defined as:
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta^{pre}_p(k)=\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}||\tilde{p}^h(k+i|k)-p^h(k+i)||_2\label{eqn:pred_err}
	\end{equation}
	
	Different from the IMM-based prediction approaches that extrapolate the human position by a weighted sum of the predicted positions from each model, the single-model methods only utilize one of the motion models for prediction.

	\cref{fig:pred} shows the comparison of prediction error using two single-model approaches (LKF, UKF) and two IMM-based methods (IMM-LKF, IMM-UKF).
	It can be noticed that single-model approaches generate larger prediction error than IMM-based methods, especially when the human makes turns,  such as at time $50$.
	This makes sense as IMM-based methods have already considered both uniform and turn motion models.
	% \cref{table:pre_err} lists the mean and standard deviation of the prediction error using these four methods.
	% It shows that the IMM-UKF achieves minimum mean error and the IMM-KF results in the smallest standard deviation.
	Based on the simulation results, IMM-UKF is shown to outperform the other three prediction approaches.
	%For the times when the human moves in straight lines without changes in heading, the IMM-based method and the single-model approach achieves similar accuracy.
	%However, since we use a simple human behavior that the human keeps constant speed and moves in straight lines without changes in heading for a large portion of the trajectory, the single-model approach can achieve similar prediction performance as the IMM-based method.
	%However, since the human keeps constant speed and moves in straight lines without changes in heading for a large portion of the trajectory, the single-model approach can achieve similar prediction performance as the IMM-based method.
	
	\subsubsection{Robot motion planning}\label{subsubsec:motion_plan}
	\cref{fig:ref_traj_accom} shows the trajectory of the companion robot that accompanies the target person moving in the field. The trajectory is generated by the proposed MPC motion planner with five-step planning horizon ($2.5s$) and using the IMM-UKF for predicting the human and moving obstacles' trajectories.
	The performance of the motion planning is evaluated using the criterion of safety and comfort.
	To be specific, the distance and speed differences between the robot and the human at each time step are measured, which are defined as:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
		\Delta_d(k)&=||p^r(k)-p^h(k)||_2\label{eqn:err_d}\\
		\Delta_v(k)&=|v^r(k)-v^h(k)|\label{eqn:err_v}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	%	These quantities are illustrated as the blue line in \cref{fig:err_d,fig:err_v}.
	
	The performance of IMM-UKF is compared with two benchmark prediction strategies, using the same MPC planner.
	The first benchmark method uses the coordinate turn motion model and applies UKF to predict human motion.
	The second method does not predict human motion.
	Instead, the robot only utilize the human's current state for one-step ($500ms$) motion planning.
	%We compare the MPC-based motion planning with a commonly used reactive motion planning method. %using \cref{eqn:err_d,eqn:err_v}.
	%With the reactive method, the robot uses one-step prediction of human position and heads for it while keeping the safe distance from the human and matching up with the human speed.
	%Both methods utilize the predicted human states from the IMM-UKF estimation and prediction methods.

	\cref{fig:err_d} compares the distances between the human and the robot using these three strategies.
	% 	Notice that the distances in the plot has been substracted by the safety distance $d_s$.
	% 	Therefore, distance values less than zero at any time step are considered unsafe and thus undesirable.
	%     In addition, distance around $d_c-d_s$ is desired, as it implies that the robot keeps a comfortable distance $d_c$ from the human.
	It can be noticed that the MPC planner has ensured the safety of the accompanied human with each of the three prediction methods in that no distance goes below $d_s$.
	Additionally, by incorporating human motion prediction into the motion planning, the robot significantly improves its companion performance from the non-prediction case.
	In fact, the average distance between the human and the robot are 2.72, 2.88, 3.89 using the IMM-UKF, UKF and non-prediction methods respectively.
	%	This can be demonstrated by \cref{table:distance} that the mean of human-robot distance using the prediction is much smaller than that without prediction.
	Besides, the IMM-UKF achieves better performance than the UKF in that the average distance is smaller but still within the ``comfort range" using the IMM-UKF.
	%On the contrary, the reactive method results in distances greater than $1$ for xxx\% of time while the smallest distance drops to $-xxx$ at time xxx.
	% 	The IMM-UKF method achieves xxx\% improvement on average distance, xxx\% on maximum distance and also minimum distance. 
	% 	In addition, the robot using IMM-UKF as the predictor can achieve less unsafe distance than the other two approaches. 
	% 	Such improvement is desirable for an accompanying robot as it keeps proper distance from the human and only moves within the unsafe distance for xxx long. 
	% 	Such unsafty is caused when the human makes sharp turns and the prediction deviates from the actual positions, which has been discussed in \cref{subsubsec:motion_est,subsubsec:motion_pred}.
	%Specifically, when the human makes a sharp turn at $103 s$, the MPC approach generates distance differences up to 8 while the reactive method results in almost 14.
	%% Due to the robot's limited angular velocity, the distance difference becomes large, with the peak values being $7.288$ for the MPC method at time $109.5s$ and $7.844$ for the reactive method at time $110.5$.
	%% The distance difference drops to $0.060$ at time 113 using the MPC method, showing that the robot accelerates to catch up with the human.
	%% This process can be seen in \cref{fig:err_v}.
	%% However, the reactive method maintains large distance between the human and the robot, with the minimum distance of 6.551, after time $109.5s$.
	%% This shows the benefits of using the MPC framework for motion planning compared to the reactive approach.
	%The differences mainly comes from the multiple-step prediction that the MPC method utilizes.
	%Due to the limited acceleration and angular velocity, the robot needs to predict several steps ahead in order to stay within the proper distance from the human.
	%The reactive method, however, only takes into account one-step prediction.
	%This myopic strategy renders the robot less capable to adjust its states for human's future positions.
	%Another benefit of using MPC method comes from its natural incorporation of various requirements by formulating them as the objective function and the constraints.
	%In contrast, designing a reactive method that considers different requirements becomes time-consuming and even infeasible when the complexity of requirements increases.
	%\cref{fig:err_v} compares the velocity differences between the human and the robot using these two methods.
	%It can be noticed that both approaches result in comparable velocity differences.
	
	The non-prediction method achieves smaller speed difference than methods using prediction, as shown in \cref{fig:err_v}.
	This seems to imply that the non-prediction method is preferable for the robot to keep similar pace as the human.
	However, such speed similarity using non-prediction method results in large distance between the human and the robot, which is undesirable.
	The change of the speed when using prediction is caused by the motion planner's effort to keep the robot within the comfort region around the human.
	%     The benefits of including human motion prediction is also demonstrated by comparing the velocity differences, as shown in \cref{fig:err_v}.
	%     UKF and IMM-UKF predictor result in smaller differences than the non-prediction method.
	%     Moreover, the statistics shows smaller velocity difference using the IMM-UKF predictor.	
	Therefore, the simulation results show the superiority of using the IMM-UKF prediction for robot motion planning.
	% This makes sense as we explicitly requires the robot to match up with the human speed using the reactive method while in MPC method the velocity difference only composes one term in the objective function with a smaller weight than the distance term.
	% However, in spite of the small speed difference using the reactive method, the resultant large human-robot distance, as shown in \cref{fig:err_d}, renders such closeness on speed less attractive.
	% In fact, the proper distance between the human and the robot composes the core part of a human-accompanying robot.
	
	\section{CONCLUSION}\label{sec:conclusion}
	We have developed an autonomous motion planning framework for human-companion robots to accompany a target person in a socially desirable manner.
	Such companion robot can be useful for search-and-rescue scenarios by assisting humans in carrying apparatus, exploring dangerous areas or detecting survivors.
	The IMM-UKF approach that incorporates the uniform motion model and the coordinated turn motion models is proposed for human motion estimation and prediction.
	%Such multiple-model approach captures different human motion patterns, thus improving the estimation and prediction accuracy than other single-model approaches.
	Such multiple-model approach captures different human motion patterns, thus able to obtain accurate estimation and prediction.
	Based on the predicted human position and speed, a nonlinear programming is formulated using the model predictive control (MPC) approach for planning robot trajectory, which considers the safety and comfort of the robot behavior.
	%	The estimation and prediction performance using IMM-UKF is compared with LFK, UKF and IMM-LKF.
	Simulation results show superior performance in terms of the accuracy and response time in the estimation and prediction using the IMM-UKF approach compared to other three approaches: LKF, IMM-LKF and UKF, especially when the human makes curved motion or sharp turns.
	Moreover, the MPC planner is evaluated using the IMM-UKF, the UKF and non-prediction methods.
	The planner successfully ensures the safety of the accompanied person using all these prediction strategies.
	The IMM-UKF results in best robot motion behavior by keeping the robot closest to the comfort distance from the human.
	%	The MPC motion planning approach is compared with a reactive method and shows that the MPC method achieves better performance in generating smaller human-robot distance while similar performance in the velocity difference.
	% The reactive policy achieves smaller velocity differences than the MPC method.
	% However, this becomes less attractive as the resultant human-robot distance becomes very large.
	
	In the future work, we plan to compare other motion prediction methods, such as the auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) method, with IMM-UKF method.
	Besides,  enabling the robot to learn human motion model in real time is an attractive topic and may provide more accurate human motion prediction and results in better human-companion behavior.

	\section*{APPENDIX}
	\subsection{IMM-LKF Method}
	Similar to IMM-UKF, IMM-LKF works with two dynamic models: one is the uniform motion model; the other is the coordinated turn motion model. If the turn rate is a known constant in the coordinated turn motion model, the human estimation procedure can be modeled with the discrete time linear state space system as follows:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
		x^h(k+1) = Ax^h(k)+B_ww(k)\label{eqn:h_dyn}\\
		y^h(k)=Cx^h(k)+v(k)\label{eqn:observation}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $x^h(k)$ and $y^h(k)$ represent the human motion state and the observation, respectively, at the time step $k$; $w(k)$ and $v(k)$ represent process noise and measurement noise, respectively.
	$x^h(k)$ consists of four elements: $p^h_1,v^h_1,p^h_2,v^h_2$, where $p^h_1,p^h_2$ denote the longitudinal and lateral position of the human and $v^h_1,v^h_2$ the corresponding velocity.
	We use two Linear Kalman Filters in the IMM for human tracking, each corresponding to a different dynamic model: the uniform motion model and the turn motion model.
	Two models differ in the $A$ matrix and $w$ in \cref{eqn:h_dyn} while sharing the same $B_w$.
	In particular, we define the matrices as follows:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align*}
		A_U&=\left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
		1& T& 0& 0\\
		0& 1& 0& 0\\
		0& 0& 1& T\\
		0& 0& 0& 1
		\end{array}\right],\\
		A_T&=\left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
		1& \frac{\sin(\omega T)}{\omega}& 0& \frac{1-\cos(\omega T)}{\omega}\\
		0& \cos(\omega T)& 0& -\sin(\omega T)\\
		0& \frac{1-\cos(\omega T)}{\omega}& 1& \frac{\sin(\omega T)}{\omega}\\
		0& \sin(\omega T)& 0& \cos(\omega T)
		\end{array}\right],\\
		B_w&=\left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
		\frac{T^2}{2}& T& 0& 0\\
		0& 0& \frac{T^2}{2}& T
		\end{array}\right],\\
		w_U&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,Q_U)\; w_T\sim\mathcal{N}(0,Q_T)
		\end{align*}
	\end{subequations}
	where $A_U$ and $A_T$ stand for the $A$ matrices of the uniform motion model and turn motion model, respectively; $w_U$ and $w_T$ denote the process noise of the uniform motion model and turn motion model, respectively; $T$ represents the sampling time; $\omega$ represents the constant turn rate.
	
	We assume that only the human position can be measured.
	Therefore, the parameters in observation model \cref{eqn:observation} can be defined as:
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align*}
		C&=\left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
		1& 0& 0& 0\\
		0& 0& 1& 0
		\end{array}\right],\\
		v&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,V)
		\end{align*}
	\end{subequations}
	Above linear state space models are used in LKF and IMM-LKF in this paper.
	Moreover, we set the turn rate $\omega$ to be $0.1$ rad/s as a known constant, in the turn motion model in IMM-LKF. 
	
	\subsection{Approximating Static Obstacles}\label{subsec:ellip_approx}
	Static rectangular obstacles are approximated and analytically represented as ellipses, as shown in \cref{fig:approx_ellipse}.
	Let $a$ and $b$ be the length and width of a rectangular obstacle centered at the origin.
	Let \cref{eqn:ellipse} represent the ellipse that encloses the obstacle in the way that the four vertices of the rectangle lie on the boundary of the ellipse:
	\addtocounter{equation}{-2}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ellipse}
	\frac{x^2}{\alpha^2}+\frac{y^2}{\beta^2}=1
	\end{equation}
	In addition, assume that the rectangle and ellipse have the same aspect ratio, which means $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$, then by simple algebraic manipulation, we can obtain that $\alpha=\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\beta=\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}$.
	Define
	\begin{equation*}
	h(x,y)=2\frac{x^2}{a^2}+2\frac{y^2}{b^2}-1.
	\end{equation*}
	Then $h(x,y)=0$ represent the ellipse approximation of the rectangle with length $a$ and width $b$.
	Any point $(x,y)$ with $h(x,y)>0$ lies outside of the ellipse.
